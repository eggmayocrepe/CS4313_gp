      "We made arrangements with pharmaceutical companies to facilitate their clinical trials and drug development in Singapore, and attracted a few to establish vaccine manufacturing capabilities here.\n",

      "Securing early access to vaccines was a whole-of-government effort. Many agencies and public officers, led by the head of the civil service, were involved in this critical mission.\n",

      "I commend them for their good work. They are among the legion of unsung heroes who have helped us get through this crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you would have read in the news, the first vaccines are now coming into production, and I am very happy to tell you that after studying the scientific evidence and clinical trial data, the Health Sciences Authority, HSA, has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for pandemic use.\n",

      "\n",
      "So I strongly encourage you to get vaccinated, too, when the vaccine is offered to you. Because when you get yourself vaccinated, you are not just protecting yourself, you are also doing your part to protect others, especially your loved ones.\n",

      "The more of us are vaccinated, the harder it will be for the virus to spread, and the safer we will all be as a society.\n",

      "Vaccines will support our recovery in more ways than one.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a global aviation hub, we play a crucial role transporting vaccines around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vaccines require cold chain management. An ordinary refrigerator is not good enough. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at minus 70 deg C, colder than the Arctic in winter!\n",
      "\n",
      "This requires infrastructure, high standards, skilled personnel, and good connectivity to many different countries all along the supply chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, Singapore has a strong ecosystem for cargo handling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leading global logistics companies like DHL, UPS and FedEx are based here. SIA and Changi Airport's ground handling partners are certified by Iata (International Air Transport Association) to handle and transport pharmaceutical supplies.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are now gearing ourselves up to handle large volumes of vaccine shipments into Singapore and through Singapore to help win the global fight against Covid-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "We did not get here overnight. We have always planned ahead, systematically creating opportunities for ourselves. It took us years of investment and planning, building a business-friendly climate and expanding our air links around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "These long-term investments are now paying dividends.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this immediate crisis, we have reacted quickly and comprehensively, marshalled resources to solve our problems, and stayed resilient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our situation is now stable, but only because everyone has worked so hard, and sacrificed so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that vaccines are becoming available, we can see light at the end of the tunnel.\n",
      "\n",
      "As vaccinations become widespread not only in Singapore, but also in our region and the world, we can look forward to resuming more normal lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us keep up our efforts in this final stretch, to cross the finish line together, and complete our mission to defeat Covid-19.\n",
